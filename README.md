# AND101 Project 5 - Game of Thrones API: Recycler View

Time spent: **2** hours spent in total

## Summary

**Game of Thrones Character Viewer** is an android app that **generates a random character from Thrones API**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **ðŸ—¡ðŸ©¸ðŸ”¥**
